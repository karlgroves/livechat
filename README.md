# README

This is not an actual product that I plan on building. There was a time when Tenon.io was going to build its own Live Chat interface for user support and I began the process of writing a spec for it.  Ultimately we abandoned the idea, as discussed in the blog post [Build vs. Buy is even harder when you care about accessibility](http://blog.tenon.io/build-vs-buy-is-even-harder-when-you-care-about-accessibility/)
